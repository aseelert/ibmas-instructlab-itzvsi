# Banking and Finance Terms

This document provides explanations for key banking and finance terms commonly
used in customer interactions. These terms will help provide context to
customers looking to understand processes related to loans, accounts, and
credit.

## 1. Interest Rate
An interest rate is the percentage of a loan amount charged by the lender for
borrowing money. It is typically calculated annually. **Fixed interest rates**
remain the same throughout the loan term, making it easier for borrowers to
predict their payments. **Variable interest rates** can fluctuate depending on
market conditions, which may result in higher or lower payments over time.

### Example:
- A home loan with a fixed interest rate of 3.5% means the borrower will pay
  3.5% of the loan amount as interest each year.

## 2. Annual Percentage Rate (APR)
APR represents the annual cost of borrowing money, including both the interest
rate and any additional fees (such as origination fees). It provides a more
accurate picture of the total cost of a loan or credit line than the interest
rate alone. APR is expressed as a percentage, and it allows consumers to easily
compare different loan offers.

### Example:
- If a credit card has a 20% APR, the borrower will owe 20% of their outstanding
  balance annually, including interest and fees.

## 3. Credit Score
A credit score is a numerical expression of a person’s creditworthiness based on
their credit history. It helps lenders evaluate the risk of lending money to
an individual. Credit scores range from 300 to 850, with higher scores indicating
better creditworthiness. Factors that affect credit scores include payment
history, amounts owed, length of credit history, and types of credit used.

### Example:
- A person with a credit score of 750 is more likely to qualify for a loan with
  a lower interest rate than someone with a score of 600.

## 4. Mortgage
A mortgage is a loan used to purchase a home or other real estate. The property
itself serves as collateral for the loan. Mortgages typically have repayment
terms of 15, 20, or 30 years, and the borrower makes monthly payments that
include both principal (the loan amount) and interest. There are different types
of mortgages, including fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs).

### Example:
- A borrower with a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage will have the same interest rate
  and monthly payment for the life of the loan.

## 5. Loan-to-Value Ratio (LTV)
The Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio is a measure of the loan amount compared to the
value of the property being purchased. It is expressed as a percentage. Lenders
use LTV ratios to assess risk. A higher LTV ratio means the borrower is financing
a larger portion of the purchase price, which can increase the lender's risk.

### Example:
- If a borrower buys a house worth $200,000 with a $160,000 loan, the LTV ratio
  is 80% (160,000 ÷ 200,000).

## 6. Principal
The principal is the original loan amount that the borrower agrees to repay.
Each monthly payment made on a loan includes a portion that goes toward paying
down the principal and a portion that goes toward paying interest. Reducing the
principal over time lowers the amount of interest owed.

### Example:
- If you take out a $10,000 loan, the principal is $10,000, and as you make
  payments, the principal decreases.

## 7. Fixed-Rate Loan
A fixed-rate loan has an interest rate that remains the same throughout the
entire loan term. This makes the loan easier to manage, as the monthly payments
are predictable and will not change over time, even if interest rates rise
in the broader market.

### Example:
- A borrower takes out a 15-year fixed-rate loan with a 5% interest rate. The
  monthly payment remains constant for the duration of the loan.

## 8. Adjustable-Rate Mortgage (ARM)
An Adjustable-Rate Mortgage (ARM) has an interest rate that changes periodically
based on market conditions. ARMs typically offer lower initial rates than
fixed-rate loans, but the rate can increase or decrease over time, affecting the
monthly payments.

### Example:
- A borrower might start with a 3% interest rate for the first 5 years, but the
  rate could adjust to 5% or higher afterward, increasing their monthly payment.

## 9. Down Payment
A down payment is the upfront payment made when purchasing a home or other
property. It is expressed as a percentage of the property's purchase price. The
larger the down payment, the less the borrower needs to finance through a loan,
which can result in lower monthly payments and total interest costs.

### Example:
- A borrower makes a 20% down payment on a $250,000 house, contributing $50,000
  upfront and financing the remaining $200,000 with a mortgage.

## 10. Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)
Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI) is a measure used by lenders to assess a borrower's
ability to manage monthly payments and repay debts. It is calculated by dividing
the borrower’s total monthly debt payments by their gross monthly income.
Lenders prefer lower DTI ratios, as they indicate the borrower is less likely to
default on their loan.

### Example:
- If your monthly debts total $1,500 and your gross monthly income is $5,000,
  your DTI ratio is 30% (1,500 ÷ 5,000).

## 11. Prepayment Penalty
A prepayment penalty is a fee charged by some lenders if a borrower pays off
their loan early. Lenders impose these penalties to recoup some of the interest
income they would lose if the loan is paid off ahead of schedule.

### Example:
- A borrower repays their mortgage in full five years early and must pay a 2%
  prepayment penalty based on the remaining loan balance.

## 12. Home Equity
Home equity is the portion of your home’s value that you own outright. It is
calculated by subtracting your remaining mortgage balance from the current
market value of the home. As you pay down the mortgage, your equity in the home
increases.

### Example:
- If your home is worth $300,000 and you owe $200,000 on your mortgage, you have
  $100,000 in home equity.

## 13. Collateral
Collateral is an asset that a borrower pledges to a lender as security for a
loan. If the borrower fails to repay the loan, the lender can seize the
collateral to recoup their losses. Mortgages and auto loans are examples of
secured loans, where the property or vehicle serves as collateral.

### Example:
- A borrower who takes out a home loan pledges the house as collateral. If they
  default, the lender can foreclose on the home.

## 14. Closing Costs
Closing costs are the fees and expenses associated with finalizing a real estate
transaction. These costs typically include loan origination fees, appraisal
fees, title insurance, and legal fees. Closing costs are usually paid at the
time of closing, but some can be rolled into the mortgage.

### Example:
- A borrower might pay $5,000 in closing costs when buying a home, which includes
  fees for the loan application, property appraisal, and title search.

## 15. Refinancing
Refinancing involves replacing an existing loan with a new one, typically to get
better terms such as a lower interest rate or a shorter repayment period. When
you refinance a mortgage, the old loan is paid off, and a new one is created,
often with different conditions.

### Example:
- A homeowner refinances their mortgage to lower the interest rate from 6% to
  4%, reducing their monthly payment and the total interest paid over the loan
  term.
